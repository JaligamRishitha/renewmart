# Investor Interest Display in Admin Dashboard

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Type**: Feature Implementation
**Status**: âœ… Completed

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive investor interest tracking in the admin dashboard, allowing admins to see which projects are attracting investor attention.

## Problem

Admins had no visibility into investor interest when reviewing projects. They couldn't:
- See which projects were popular with investors
- Prioritize high-interest projects
- Track total investor engagement
- Make data-driven decisions about project reviews

## Solution

### Backend Changes

**File**: `backend/routers/lands.py`

1. **Admin Projects Endpoint** (lines 30-116):
   - Added LEFT JOIN with `investor_interests` table
   - Added `investor_interest_count` aggregation
   - Returns `investorInterestCount` for each project

2. **Admin Summary Endpoint** (lines 119-175):
   - Added investor interest statistics query
   - Returns `totalInvestorInterests` (total count)
   - Returns `totalInvestors` (unique investors)

### Frontend Changes

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/admin-dashboard/index.jsx`

1. **New Metrics Card**:
   - Added 5th card showing "Investor Interest"
   - Displays total interests and unique investors
   - Updated grid from 4 to 5 columns

2. **Task Data Mapping**:
   - Added `investorInterestCount` to each task/project
   - Passes data to TaskTable component

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/admin-dashboard/components/TaskTable.jsx`

1. **Interest Badge**:
   - Orange badge with user icon next to project name
   - Only shows when count > 0
   - Displays number of investor interests

## Features

### Dashboard Metrics
- **New Card**: "Investor Interest" showing total interests
- **Subtext**: Shows number of unique investors
- **Icon**: Users icon
- **Color**: Orange/accent

### Project Table
- **Badge**: Orange badge next to project names
- **Icon**: Users icon (ðŸ‘¥)
- **Count**: Number of interested investors
- **Visibility**: Only shows when > 0

### Real-Time Data
- Fetches on dashboard load
- Updates with filters
- No caching delays

## Visual Design

```
Metrics Row:
[Pending] [Under Review] [Published] [Capacity] [Investor Interest: 12]
                                                  5 investors

Project Table:
Solar Farm ðŸ‘¥ 5     John Doe    Solar    Published
Wind Project        Jane Smith  Wind     Reviewing
Hydro Plant ðŸ‘¥ 3    Bob Brown   Hydro    Published
```

## API Updates

### GET /api/lands/admin/projects
**Added to response**:
```json
{
  "investorInterestCount": 5
}
```

### GET /api/lands/admin/summary
**Added to response**:
```json
{
  "totalInvestorInterests": 12,
  "totalInvestors": 5
}
```

## Database Query

```sql
-- Admin Projects with Interest Count
SELECT 
    l.*,
    COALESCE(COUNT(DISTINCT ii.interest_id), 0) as investor_interest_count
FROM lands l
LEFT JOIN investor_interests ii ON l.land_id = ii.land_id
WHERE l.status != 'draft'
GROUP BY l.land_id
```

## Benefits

âœ… **Market Validation**: See which projects are popular
âœ… **Prioritization**: Focus on high-interest projects
âœ… **Visibility**: At-a-glance investor engagement
âœ… **Data-Driven**: Make informed review decisions
âœ… **Efficiency**: All data in one dashboard

## Testing

### Scenarios Tested
- [x] No interests (shows 0, no badges)
- [x] Single interest per project
- [x] Multiple interests per project
- [x] Real-time updates on refresh

### Verification
- [x] Metrics card shows correct totals
- [x] Badges appear on correct projects
- [x] Counts match database
- [x] Performance acceptable

## Files Modified

1. `backend/routers/lands.py` - API updates
2. `frontend/src/pages/admin-dashboard/index.jsx` - Metrics card
3. `frontend/src/pages/admin-dashboard/components/TaskTable.jsx` - Interest badge

## Documentation
