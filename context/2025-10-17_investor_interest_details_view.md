# Investor Interest Details View Implementation

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Type**: Feature Implementation  
**Status**: âœ… Completed

## Summary

Created a comprehensive investor interest details page where admins can view complete information about investors and their interests in renewable energy projects.

## Problem Solved

User reported: "I am not able to see the investors interest and his details in the admin portal"

Previously, admins could only see:
- Count of interests (number badge)
- Total interests in metrics card

Now admins can see:
- Complete investor details (name, email, phone)
- Investment amounts
- Project details
- Messages from investors
- Status of each interest
- And much more!

## Implementation

### Backend API

**New Endpoint**: `GET /api/lands/admin/investor-interests`

**File**: `backend/routers/lands.py` (lines 178-240)

**Query**: Joins 4 tables to get complete information:
- `investor_interests` - The interest records
- `lands` - Project details
- `user` (investor) - Investor information
- `user` (landowner) - Landowner information

**Returns**: Array of detailed interest objects with all relevant info

### Frontend Implementation

**New Page**: `frontend/src/pages/admin-investor-interests/index.jsx`

**Features**:
- Statistics cards (Total, Pending, Unique Investors, Investment)
- Searchable and filterable table
- Color-coded status badges
- Project type badges
- Action buttons (View Project, View Message)
- Responsive design
- Loading and empty states

**Route**: `/admin-investor-interests`

**Protection**: Admin/Reviewer only (ReviewerRoute)

### UI/UX Enhancements

**Clickable Metrics Card**:
- Updated MetricsCard component to accept `onClick` prop
