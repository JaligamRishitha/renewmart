# Admin Marketplace Routing Implementation

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Type**: Feature Implementation
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Summary

Created a dedicated admin marketplace page with routing to display all published renewable energy projects with comprehensive filtering and statistics.

## What Was Built

### 1. Admin Marketplace Page
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/admin-marketplace/index.jsx`

A full-featured marketplace dashboard showing:
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Total published, capacity, avg price, interest count
- **Advanced Filters**: Search, energy type, capacity range, price range, location
- **Project Cards**: Detailed information for each published project
- **Actions**: View details, refresh data, clear filters

### 2. Route Configuration
**File**: `frontend/src/Routes.jsx`

Added new route:
```jsx
<Route path="/admin-marketplace" element={
  <ReviewerRoute>
    <AdminMarketplace />
  </ReviewerRoute>
} />
```

Protected by `ReviewerRoute` - requires admin or reviewer role.

### 3. Navigation Integration
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/admin-dashboard/index.jsx`

Added "Marketplace" button in admin dashboard header:
- Icon: Store
- Navigate to: `/admin-marketplace`
- Position: Between "Review Queue" and "Generate Report"

## Features Implemented

### Statistics Cards (4)
1. **Total Published**: Count of published projects
2. **Total Capacity**: Sum of all capacities in MW
3. **Average Price**: Average $/MWh across all projects

### Filters (7)
1. Search (title, location, developer, landowner)
2. Energy Type (dropdown)
3. Min Capacity (MW)
4. Max Capacity (MW)
5. Min Price ($/MWh)
6. Max Price ($/MWh)
7. Location (text input)

### Project Information (per card)
- Title with energy type badge

### Smart States
