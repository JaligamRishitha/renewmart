# Reviewer Dashboard Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Reviewer Dashboard provides role-specific access to documents and task management for three key reviewer roles as defined in `Workflow.txt`:
- **RE Sales Advisor**: Market evaluation and investor alignment
- **RE Analyst**: Technical and financial feasibility analysis
- **RE Governance Lead**: Compliance, regulatory, and local authority validation

- Track progress with visual status indicators

### 3. **Status Updates**

- **Pending** (gray): Not yet started

- **Delayed** (orange): Behind schedule
- **Completed** (green): Finished successfully
- **Rejected** (red): Issues found, requires attention

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Reviewer sees no documents**
**Solutions:**
1. Check document `document_type` matches role mappings
2. Ensure documents are uploaded to the correct land
3. Verify task has `land_id` associated

### **Issue: Can't update task status**
**Solutions:**
1. Check user has correct reviewer role
2. Verify task is assigned to current user
3. Check backend `/api/tasks/{task_id}` endpoint is working
4. Ensure backend is restarted after schema changes

### **Issue: Wrong dashboard displayed**
**Solutions:**
1. Check user roles in database
2. Verify login redirect logic
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Check `RoleBasedRedirect` component logic

### **Issue: All documents showing instead of filtered**
**Solutions:**
1. Verify `ROLE_DOCUMENTS` mapping in `reviewer-dashboard/index.jsx`
2. Check document type format (hyphen vs underscore)
3. Ensure filter logic is working correctly
