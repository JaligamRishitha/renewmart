## Expected Behavior

### Registration Success Flow:
```

    ↓
Backend creates account
    ↓
Toast 1: "Account created successfully!" (green)
    ↓
1.5 seconds delay
    ↓
Toast 2: "Redirecting to login page..." (blue)
    ↓
1.5 seconds delay
    ↓
Navigate to /login
    ↓
Email prefilled
```

### Logout Flow:
```
User clicks "Logout" in More menu
    ↓
AuthContext.logout() called
    ↓
localStorage cleared
    ↓
Navigate to /login
    ↓
User must login again
```

## Quick Test Commands

### Start Frontend:
```bash
cd renewmart/frontend
npm run dev
```

### Start Backend:
```bash
cd renewmart/backend
python server.py
```

### Check localStorage:
```javascript
// In browser console
localStorage.getItem('authToken')  // Should be null after logout
localStorage.getItem('user')       // Should be null after logout
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Registration shows TWO toast messages sequentially  
✅ Redirects to login automatically after 3 seconds total  
✅ Email is prefilled in login form  
✅ "Settings" is completely removed from More menu  
✅ "Logout" appears in red in More menu  
✅ Clicking Logout clears auth and redirects  
✅ Works in both desktop and mobile views  
✅ No console errors  

## All Good? 🎉

If all tests pass, you're done! The UX improvements are working perfectly.

### Next Steps:
